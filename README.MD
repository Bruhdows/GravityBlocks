# GravityBlocks

Created in about 2 hours during KasaiSora's plugin review stream.

A simple plugin that allows you to spawn blocks that interact with gravity and each other. 

Due to time constraints, it hasn't been uploaded to Modrinth yet, and verification would likely take longer than needed.

## Commands

- `/gravityblock stick` - Get a gravity stick
- `/gravityblock spawn <material> [size]` - Spawn a gravity block
- `/gravityblock cleanup` - Remove all gravity blocks

## Controls

- **Right Click** - Grab or release blocks
- **Left Click** - Delete or throw blocks
